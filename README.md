● The dashboard should show information about total cases, total deaths
and recovered count using graphs like pie charts, histograms, bar graphs,
line charts ...etc(At least 2 graphs from which we can get useful information
just by looking at them, you can use any of the flutter packages to
generate graphs).
● By default cumulative global data should be shown.
● We need to have filters where we can filter by country, filter by dates.
● For the US only we need to have an extra filter where we can filter the data
state wise.
